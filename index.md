# PHPMD - PHP Mess Detector

This is the project site of _PHPMD_. It is a spin-off project of PHP Depend 
and aims to be a PHP equivalent of the well known Java tool PMD. 
PHPMD can be seen as an user friendly and easy to configure frontend for the 
raw metrics measured by PHP Depend.

What PHPMD does is: It takes a given PHP source code base and look for 
several potential problems within that source. 
These problems can be things like:
* Possible bugs
* Suboptimal code
* Overcomplicated expressions
* Unused parameters, methods, properties

PHPMD is a young project and so it only provides a limited set of pre defined rules, 
compared with its brother PMD, that detect code smells and possible errors 
within the analyzed source code. 
Checkout the rules section to learn more about all implemented rules.
